Apriori Pseudocode

Apriori(T (set of the sets of data), minsup (minimum support level to
still be considered "frequent")

                     Transaction Class

Functions:
1. subset: used to check if set of items is contained within the
transaction
returns true/false

Variables:
set of items

#################################################################

Parser function: Used to get information and put the data into
transactions
parser()
returns T

Count 1-itemsets and keep only those with counts greater than or equal
to minsup with function:
one_item_sets(T, minsup)

this function calls frequency_qualifier(item_dict), which takes in
item_dict (L1) and minsup as input, and outputs f_item_dict, which is
the item_dict with itemsets whose counts are greater than or equal to
minsup

returns L1 (the 1-itemsets with counts greater than or equal to minsup)

generate function:
generate(L1)
returns Ck (the possible item sets that could be used (doesn't include
the itemsets with counts greater/equal to minsup)

subset function:
subset(Ck,t (transactions))
returns Ct (the sets in Ck that were found in the transactions)

data in
text file

sets of tokens

1 token per line; token > 0
set = collection of tokens; one on each line;
there will be one more blank lines separating sets

each transaction  = an object
transaction has a method: subset to check if a set of items is contained
within the transaction

numbers = items
